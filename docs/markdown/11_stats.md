# Queue Like List

In the last section we learned how to update the `Last 10 values` section 
so that older values get pushed down everytime new values come in.

In this section we will work on calculating the Avg, Max and Min and 
displaying those calculations in the `Stats on the last 10 values` section.

<hr>

All we need to do here is create helper functions that can calculate the Avg, 
Max and Min then display the calculations. 

``` javascript
```
